### Goals

The goal of this project is to identify relevant variables that could come into play
for a data auto-completion application required by Sant√© Publique France.

### Data overview

The data is the Open Food Facts dataset. It's a quite large dataset with more than 160 variables;

Only relevant variables to the goal of this project were kept.

As I chose to focus on the Nutri-score related data, I reduced the dataset scope to 22 variables:

- General qualitative product information:
	Product name
	Brand
	Country of origin
	Product category
	Product main category

- Nutritional quantitative information:
	Nutritional values per 100g for variables with less than 80% missing values

-  Nutri-score

2.

3.
